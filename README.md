# LRC Shifter

I couldn't find a simple tool to easily shift the timestamps of an LRC file so I made my own one. Enjoy. Useful if your media player does not support the LRC format's offset tag.

Just download the executable from the [releases](https://github.com/BerriUQAM/LRC-Shifter/releases) page (or the .ahk file if you already have AutoHotkey v1.1+ installed on your system) and run it. A new LRC file with the shifted timestamps will be created in the same directory as the original file.

You can also use it in a command line: `"LRC Shifter.[exe|ahk]" file_path offset_in_ms`, for example `"LRC Shifter.exe" "My love.lrc" -750`
